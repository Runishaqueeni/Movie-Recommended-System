# Movie-Recommended-System
I built a movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user’s selected movie. It works by converting movie genres into numerical vectors using TF-IDF and calculating similarity scores using cosine similarity. Based on the highest similarity values, the system recommends top 5 similar movies.
